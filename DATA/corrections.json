["Reunion in London.", "Silver Streak, the speed king!.. And Whiz!... I thought you two were back in the United States fighting gangsters!", "We were... Until we discovered there were worse gangsters on this side of the pond... Hitler and company!", "Pip... Pip! Fawncy meeting you here!", "And now, gentlemen, let's get down to business. First, Silver Streak, I should like to hear your report on that mysterious cottage on the downs!", "Don't make a hero out of me, Silver Streak... I'm too modest.", "I believe they're keeping pigeons in violation of the war regulations! Whiz nailed one as it was entering a window of the cottage!", "I pulled a power-dive on him!", "Did it carry a message?", "No! I suspect the message had already been delivered... To Hitler!", "There is only one thing to do... Go back and keep an eye on the place. But be careful! We are pitted against desperate, cunning men!", "Leaving Daredevil and Churchill, Silver Streak and Whiz zip past a London Bobby.", "Shall we take a train, Whiz?", "With our speed? Don't be a sap!", "Blimey! I must be seeing things!", "On a few minutes, they reach a dismal stretch of sand on the North Downs, miles from London.", "That window!... It's opening! Get set, Whiz... You may have work to do!", "I'll let him have both barrels!", "A carrier pigeon flies from the lighted window. Whiz takes off from Silver Streak's shoulder.", "Okay, Whiz! Do your stuff!", "Sixty miles an hour with gas to spare!"]
