## We Develop with Github
We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## Pull Requests
Hereâ€™s how you can make a pull request:
1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. Make sure your code lints.
3. Issue that pull request!

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/luananova/Transforming-Comics-into-Accessible-Audio-Narratives/issues)
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/luananova/Transforming-Comics-into-Accessible-Audio-Narratives/issues/new); it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code
**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:
- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can.
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

People *love* thorough bug reports.

## Use a Consistent Coding Style
* You can use any code style you prefer, just be consistent.
* If possible, link to a coding standard or style guide that you followed.
